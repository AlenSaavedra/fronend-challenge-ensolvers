# Frontend - Notes Web Application

This is the frontend of the web application for taking notes, tagging them, and filtering them. The application is structured as a SPA (Single Page Application), using only **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for user interaction.

- Tag notes for better organization.
- Filter notes by tags.
- Simple and functional user interface.

## Technologies Used
